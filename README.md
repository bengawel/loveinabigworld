Love Is a Big World is a SPA developed with ReactJS for CS 4278: Principles of Software Engineering at Vanderbilt University

Setup:
1) Install MongoDB and npm
2) Start up MongoDB and ensure the app is set to connect to your server (i.e. modify mongoose.connect('mongodb://...') in index.js as needed) 
3) Navigate to the loveinabigworld directory and run "npm run build" (you may be asked to install dependencies first)
4) Run "npm run start" from the same directory, the app should give a message indicating it is connected to the server and listing the appropriate port
5) Navigate to the appropriate url in any web browser (default is http://localhost:8080) and the app should be displayed
